A Matlab implementation of 
Infinite Plaid Models and Bayesian Plaid Models

Written by Katsuhiko Ishiguro

This package contains a Matlab implementations of the Plaid models 
for the demonstration of the following paper(s): 

Ishiguro, Sato, Nakano, Kimura, and Ueda, 
"Infinite Plaid Models for Infinite Bi-clustering", 
in Proc. AAAI, 2016. 

# Licensing terms

Before using (a part of) this package, 
you must read carefully and agree the content of license.docx attached. 


# How to use 
First, run initpath.m to include the 'util' directory into the matlab path. 
Then, go to the directory you want to try. 
Run {BayesPlaid, InfinitePlaid}_run.m then the program will start. 

# Directories

BayesPlaid_Simplified: constant bias observation with fixed cardinality, K, of sub-matrices
InfinitePlaid_Simplified: constant bias observation with infinite cardinality of sub-matrices
utils: some matlab functions
data: synthetic data
